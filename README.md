| The calculator must contain a clickable element containing an equal sign  |     |   x   |
| The calculator must contain 10 clickable elements with numbers from 0 to 9  |      |  x  |
| The calculator must contain 4 clickable elements each one with the primary mathematical operators "add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"  |  x   |      |
| The calculator must contain a clickable element with a period "." that will add a decimal to our number   |  x   |      |
| The calculator must contain a clickable element with the following character "C" that will clear all the state of the calculator; the input and output values and returns the calc to 0'   |  x   |      |
| The calculator must contain an element to display the values for the calculator   |     |   x   |
| As a user when I input numbers, I should be able to see them in the display =  |     |   x  |
| At any time and in any order, I should be able to multiply, divide, subtract and add a chain of numbers of any length and after hitting equal the display should show the correct result   |     |      |
| No number can begin with multiple 0's   |     |      |
| When clicking the decimal or period element a '.' should be added to the current number and only one decimal can be present per number   |     |      |
| If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + * 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e., 5 * 7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e., 5 * (-5)).  |     |      |
| Pressing an operator immediately following the equal sing (=) should start a new calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.  |     |      |
